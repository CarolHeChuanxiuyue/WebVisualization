                With the check-out records of the Seattle library, I am interested in how popularity of the epic fantasy novel series “A Song of Ice and Fire” changes over years. Moreover, the original novels became in the public eye because of the premiere of the HBO television series “Game of Thrones” which names after the first novel of the series. Thus, I believe the checkouts of the novels fluctuate as a new season of the TV series comes out. Since 2020 was just off to a start when I was doing this analysis, I only investigated the check-out records from 2006 to 2019.<br>

                I first checked the list of all items related to "A Song of Ice and Fire" including all books and DVDs.<br>
                From the output table, the book “Greeky chef cookbook” was included because the food it introduces is similar to the food in Game of thrones. However, this book is not directly related to the fantacies themselves. Thus, we excluded these kinds of book in the following analysis.<br>
